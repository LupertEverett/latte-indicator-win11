# Latte Win11 Indicator
This is a Win11 style indicator for [Latte Dock](https://phabricator.kde.org/source/latte-dock/repository/master/), based on [Latte Win10 indicator](https://github.com/psifidotos/latte-indicator-win10).

# Notes

- The "more than 1 window effect" needs better stylization, I think.

- I don't (and cannot) use Win11, so I have no idea how accurate this indicator is.

Any help regarding those points above would be appreciated. I am gonna try my best to improve upon this but... QML is still something that makes my head spin.
